# ZipperMate

I have created an asp.net application that uses the MVC template to display all the products offered by the fictional company called "ZipperMate". Along with the catalogue, I have also included an About Us page. This page provides a brief description of the company,
its culture, and the variety of products it provides. Additionally, I have revamped the index page by adding several front-end adjustments to match the feel and aesthetic of my fictional company. I used Bootstrap for the majority of my front-end design 
as it is quick and efficient in creating clean and professional layouts, as well as maintaining a nice UX and UI.
